Details of each scenario described below.

## CONDA: Use `conda` to install Clojupyter on Linux, MacOS and Windows

This mode is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  

## Compile Uberjar: Compile Cλ as uberjar and install as kernel

This is the easiest way to get started with the latest features of Clojupyter. Follow the
instructions below to compile and install Clojupyter as a kernel.

First install [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure).

### Build

Checkout [this repo](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter) on the master branch and build an "uberjar":

Building an uberjar:

```bash
clj -T:build uber

WARNING: parse-boolean already refers to: #'clojure.core/parse-boolean in namespace: omniconf.core, being replaced by: #'omniconf.core/parse-boolean
target/clojupyter-0.4.321-standalone.jar
```

### Install kernel

Note: replace `--jarfile` below with the path to the jar you just built.

For example:
```
clj -M -m clojupyter.cmdline install --jarfile target/clojupyter-0.4.321-standalone.jar --ident clojupyter-0.4.321
```

Verify:

```
clj -M -m clojupyter.cmdline list-installs

WARNING: parse-boolean already refers to: #'clojure.core/parse-boolean in namespace: omniconf.core, being replaced by: #'omniconf.core/parse-boolean
Clojupyter v0.4.321@321 - All Clojupyter kernels

    |              IDENT |                                          DIR |
    |--------------------+----------------------------------------------|
    | clojupyter-0.4.321 | ~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/clojupyter-0.4.321 |

exit(0)
```

### Check that everything works

Install [jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/install) if you haven't already. On MacOS you might do:

```
brew install jupyterlab
```

Validate that it's working:
```
jupyter lab --version
4.0.9
```


Now you can try a console (use the kernel name you installed above):

```
jupyter-console --kernel=clojupyter-0.4.321

WARNING: parse-boolean already refers to: #'clojure.core/parse-boolean in namespace: omniconf.core, being replaced by: #'omniconf.core/parse-boolean
Jupyter console 6.6.3

Clojupyter (0.4.321)
```

Or, you can run in jupyter lab (e.g. from this repo):

```
jupyter lab
```

then open a file like: `examples/demo-clojupyter.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Download Uberjar
If you do not need the latest features of Clojupyter, this is a convenient way to get started.

### Download
From [clojupyter/releases](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter/releases), download the file `clojupyter-<VERSION>.jar`, where`<VERSION>` stands for your choice, e.g. `0.4.332-standalone`)

### Check with "Hello World"
Java being ready, run a Clojure "hello, world" on the command line, e.g.
```
java -cp clojupyter-0.4.332-standalone.jar clojupyter.cmdline eval '(str "Hello " "Jupyter!")'
```
Not only does the command line interface support `eval` for running "hello, world". With just having Java on your computer (no Clojure CLI necessary), you will use it to install and remove Clojupyter kernels (see above).

### JupyterLab installation alternative
If you just temporarily want to try out JupyterLab, install it using Python's `pip`.
```
mkdir python_venv
python3 -m venv python_venv
source python_venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```

## LIB: Include Clojupyter in your Clojure project

Clojupyter is available as a library on [Clojars](https://clojars.org/) and
can be used exactly like any other library.  If you add a Clojupyter
dependency to your project, your system will gain the ability to install
itself as a Clojupyter kernel.  You can use `clj` or your project uberjar to
manage your Clojupyter kernels (install, list, remove).

Here's an example: https://github.com/krukow/edmondson 

Clojupyter has no known platform-specific depedencies and should work on all
platforms supported by Clojure.  However, using Clojupyter in the LIB usage
scenario necessarily requires installation of Clojure on the platform in
question.  Presently Clojure seems to have better support on Linux and MacOS
that it does on Windows - hopefully this will be rectified in the near future.
Users who successfully install Clojure on Windows (cf.
[TDEPS-67](https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows)
for details on improving Clojure's support for Windows) should be able to use
Clojupyter. 

Using Clojupyter as a library provides some of the same functionality as that
provided by [`lein-jupyter`](https://github.com/clojupyter/lein-jupyter),
namely the ability to provision a Clojupyter kernel with custom functionality,
but without depending on [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/).  This enables
the use of Clojupyter in projects which use the
[`tools.deps`](https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha) and
[Boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) build tools.  Note that functionality
provided does not cover *all* of what is provided by `lein-jupyter` since it
also provides the ability to use
[Parinfer](https://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/) with Jupyter notebooks
which Clojupyter currently doesn't.

See [Using Clojupyter as a library](library.md) for details on how use
Clojupyter as a library and install custom kernels.

## ADHOC: Connect Clojupyter to runnning Clojure image

**Note:** *This usage scenario is not currently supported but is included for
completeness' sake. We hope to support it sometime in the future.*

In the future we want to enable connecting Jupyter to a running Clojure image
- this would enable using Jupyter as an ad-hoc user interface to Clojure by
allowing expressions entered into Jupyter to be evaluated in the remote
Clojure instance.  Some development work is needed before remote evaluation is
possible, however, so we're not quite there yet.  See [TODO list on
Clojupyter's github page](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter#todo) for
an outline of planned features.

Usage scenario **ADHOC** overview:

| **FEATURE**             | **COMMENT**                                                   |

## deprecated: CONDA: Use `conda` to install Clojupyter on Linux, MacOS and Windows

Old/deprecated instructins for installing Clojupyter using Anaconda.

Clojupyter supports [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.org) which used to be the
installation method [recommended by the Jupyter
project](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-jupyter-using-anaconda-and-conda).
If you are new to Clojupyter and/or Clojure, we recommend that you use this
method to install Clojupyter.

Installing Clojupyter using Anaconda gets you a generic Clojupyter kernel
providing essentially unlimited functionality.  One of the key advantages to
the Conda install is that, by leveraging the infrastructure provided by
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.org), it provides a very simple way to install
Clojupyter on both **Linux**, **MacOS** and **Windows**: All you need to do is
(1) install Anaconda and (2) use a single command to install Clojupyter.

See [Conda-installing Clojupyter](conda-installing.md) for details on how to
install Clojupyter using Anaconda.

The limitation of conda-installing Clojupyter is that the install artifacts,
which are deployed in the Anaconda Cloud, are generic and thus the installed
kernel cannot include any libraries or code you would like to use.  This does
not prevent you from using any code or library you want: you simply load it at
the start of each session which is acceptable for many uses, not least when
you just starting out with Clojupyter.

If you to use Clojupyter kernels which have *custom* functionality built into
the installed kernel, you will probably want to review at the LIB usage
scenario below and take a look at [Using Clojupyter as a library](library.md).

| Disadvantage            | No custom code in kernel - must be loaded in each session |
